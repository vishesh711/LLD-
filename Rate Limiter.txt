# Rate Limiter.txt - System Design Explanation

## Overview
The Rate Limiter.py file implements a sliding window rate limiting algorithm, which is used to control the rate of operations a user can perform in a given time window. This is a crucial component in many distributed systems and APIs to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

## Key Components

1. **RateLimiter Class**:
   - Manages request limits per user within a specified time window
   - Uses a sliding window approach for precise rate limiting
   - Maintains a history of user requests using a deque (double-ended queue)

2. **Key Methods**:
   - `process_logs()`: Reads and processes log files to build request history
   - `can_make_request()`: Checks if a user can make a request based on their recent activity
   - Implements efficient cleanup of expired requests using the deque's popleft() operation

## Data Structures Used
- **Deque (collections.deque)**: Efficient for adding/removing from both ends with O(1) complexity
- **Dictionary (user_requests)**: Maps users to their request histories for O(1) lookups

## Why This Appears in LLD Interviews
- Tests your understanding of rate limiting algorithms (crucial for API design)
- Evaluates your ability to handle time-based operations
- Assesses your knowledge of efficient data structures
- Examines your approach to performance optimization in high-traffic systems

## Design Considerations
- **Sliding Window**: More accurate than fixed window counters
- **Memory Efficiency**: Only stores necessary request data within the time window
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for checking if a request is allowed
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of requests within the time window

## Interview Tips
- Be prepared to explain different rate limiting algorithms (token bucket, leaky bucket, fixed window)
- Discuss distributed rate limiting challenges (race conditions, synchronization)
- Consider how you would handle edge cases (clock skew, server restarts)
- Explain how you would scale this solution for millions of users
- Be ready to discuss persistence strategies for rate limit data
