# ParkingLot.txt - System Design Explanation

## Overview
The ParkingLot.py file implements a parking lot management system, one of the most frequently asked LLD (Low-Level Design) interview questions. This design demonstrates class relationships, state management, and resource allocation - all fundamental aspects of object-oriented design.

## Key Components

1. **ParkingSpot Class**:
   - Represents an individual parking spot with a unique ID and type
   - Manages the state of a spot (empty or occupied)
   - Provides methods to assign and remove vehicles

2. **Vehicle Class**:
   - Represents a vehicle with license plate and type information
   - Encapsulates vehicle details that are relevant to parking

3. **ParkingLot Class**:
   - Central manager that orchestrates the entire system
   - Maintains a collection of parking spots
   - Handles vehicle entry and exit
   - Implements spot allocation strategy based on vehicle type
   - Tracks capacity and availability

## Design Patterns and Principles Used
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a clear and specific purpose
- **Factory Method**: The ParkingLot creates parking spots with different types
- **Strategy Pattern**: The spot allocation strategy could be extended to support different algorithms

## Why This Appears in LLD Interviews
- Tests your ability to model real-world entities and their relationships
- Evaluates your approach to resource allocation problems
- Assesses your understanding of state management
- Examines your ability to design extensible systems
- Verifies your grasp of object-oriented principles

## Interview Tips
- Be prepared to discuss how you would extend the system for pricing models
- Consider how you would handle reserved parking or time-limited spots
- Discuss optimization strategies for spot allocation (closest spot, etc.)
- Be ready to explain how you would scale this system for multiple parking lots
- Consider how you would implement monitoring and analytics features
- Discuss how you would handle edge cases (full lot, vehicle type mismatch, etc.)
