# Course_Schedule.txt - Topological Sort Implementation Explanation

## Overview
The Course_Schedule.py file implements a course scheduling system using topological sorting, which is a common algorithm for dependency resolution. This problem appears frequently in LLD interviews, as it tests your understanding of graph algorithms, dependency management, and cycle detection.

## Key Components

1. **Course Class**:
   - Represents a course with a unique ID
   - Contains a list of prerequisite course IDs
   - Forms the nodes in our dependency graph

2. **CourseScheduler Class**:
   - Maintains a graph of course dependencies
   - Implements topological sorting using Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Detects cycles in the dependency graph (which would make a valid schedule impossible)
   - Provides a method to find a valid course order

3. **Topological Sort Implementation**:
   - Uses DFS to traverse the dependency graph
   - Tracks visited and currently-visiting nodes to detect cycles
   - Builds the result order by adding courses after their prerequisites
   - Returns an empty list if a cycle is detected (impossible schedule)

## Data Structures and Algorithms Used
- **Directed Graph**: Represents course dependencies
- **Depth-First Search**: Traverses the graph
- **Topological Sorting**: Orders elements based on dependencies
- **Cycle Detection**: Identifies impossible schedules

## Why This Appears in LLD Interviews
- Tests your understanding of graph algorithms
- Evaluates your ability to handle dependency relationships
- Assesses your knowledge of cycle detection
- Examines your approach to designing a practical scheduling system
- Verifies your understanding of time and space complexity

## Interview Tips
- Be prepared to explain the time complexity (O(V+E) where V=vertices/courses, E=edges/prerequisites)
- Discuss alternative implementations (Kahn's algorithm using BFS)
- Consider how you would handle additional constraints (time slots, room availability)
- Be ready to optimize the solution for large numbers of courses
- Explain how you would handle real-world course scheduling challenges
- Discuss how you would implement course recommendations based on this algorithm
