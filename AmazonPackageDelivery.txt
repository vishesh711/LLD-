# AmazonPackageDelivery.txt - Locker System Design Explanation

## Overview
The AmazonPackageDelivery.py file implements an Amazon-style package locker system, where packages can be delivered to lockers of appropriate sizes and picked up by customers using unique codes. This is a highly relevant LLD (Low-Level Design) interview problem, especially for Amazon, as it models one of their actual services.

## Key Components

1. **Locker Class**:
   - Represents a physical locker with ID and size attributes
   - Tracks occupancy state (empty or containing a package)
   - Provides methods to occupy and release the locker

2. **Package Class**:
   - Models a package with its ID, dimensions, and pickup code
   - Tracks which locker it's assigned to
   - Links the physical package to the system representation

3. **LockerManager Class**:
   - Central orchestrator for the locker system
   - Maintains collections of lockers categorized by size
   - Implements the locker allocation algorithm based on package dimensions
   - Generates unique pickup codes
   - Manages the relationship between packages and lockers

4. **UserInterface Class**:
   - Handles customer interactions for package pickup
   - Verifies pickup codes and processes package retrieval
   - Provides feedback on pickup success or failure

5. **DeliveryInterface Class**:
   - Handles delivery personnel interactions
   - Processes new package placement requests
   - Allocates appropriate lockers for packages

## Design Patterns and Principles Used
- **Singleton Pattern**: LockerManager is a single instance shared by interfaces
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allocation strategy for finding the right locker size
- **Facade Pattern**: UserInterface and DeliveryInterface provide simplified access to the system
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a specific focused role

## Why This Appears in LLD Interviews
- Tests your ability to model a real-world Amazon service
- Evaluates your approach to resource allocation problems
- Assesses your understanding of multiple interacting components
- Examines your ability to design secure yet user-friendly systems
- Verifies your knowledge of object-oriented design principles

## Interview Tips
- Be prepared to discuss how you would handle edge cases (all lockers full, wrong size lockers)
- Consider how you would implement locker reservation or time-limited storage
- Discuss how you would scale this system for multiple locker locations
- Be ready to explain security considerations for the pickup code system
- Consider how you would optimize the locker allocation algorithm
- Explain how you would implement analytics and monitoring for the system
