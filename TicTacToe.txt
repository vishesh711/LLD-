# TicTacToe.txt - Game System Design Explanation

## Overview
The TicTacToe.py file implements a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. This is a common LLD (Low-Level Design) interview problem that tests your understanding of class design, game state management, and turn-based mechanics.

## Key Components

1. **Board Class**:
   - Manages the game grid (3x3)
   - Handles display of the board
   - Provides methods for making moves and checking win conditions
   - Checks for valid moves and board state (full/winner)

2. **Player Class**:
   - Represents a player with their symbol (X or O)
   - Handles player input for making moves

3. **Game Class**:
   - Orchestrates the game flow
   - Manages player turns
   - Handles game state transitions
   - Determines win/draw conditions

## Design Patterns and Principles Used
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a specific role
- **State Pattern**: The game tracks and manages different states (player turn, win, draw)
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separation between game logic (model), display (view), and input handling (controller)

## Why This Appears in LLD Interviews
- Tests your ability to design a system with multiple interacting components
- Evaluates your approach to state management
- Assesses your understanding of game logic and rules enforcement
- Examines your ability to handle user input and validation

## Interview Tips
- Be prepared to discuss how you would extend the game (e.g., larger board, different win conditions)
- Consider how you would implement an AI player
- Discuss how you would add networking for multiplayer
- Be ready to explain how you'd handle edge cases (invalid inputs, unexpected state changes)
- Consider how you would optimize the win-checking algorithm for larger boards
