# UI.txt - View Hierarchy System Explanation

## Overview
The UI.py file implements a simple View Hierarchy system similar to what is used in UI frameworks like Android or iOS. This is a classic LLD (Low-Level Design) interview problem that tests your understanding of tree structures and recursive traversal algorithms.

## Key Components

1. **View Class**:
   - Represents a UI component with a unique ID
   - Contains child views (forming a tree structure)
   - Has methods to add child views

2. **find_view_by_id Function**:
   - Implements a recursive tree traversal algorithm to find a view by its ID
   - Uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the view hierarchy
   - Returns the view if found, otherwise returns None

## Design Patterns Used
- **Composite Pattern**: Views can contain other views, creating a tree-like structure
- **Recursive Tree Traversal**: Used for searching through the view hierarchy

## Why This Appears in LLD Interviews
- Tests your ability to model hierarchical relationships
- Assesses your understanding of tree data structures
- Evaluates your knowledge of recursive algorithms
- Examines your approach to designing a common UI component system

## Interview Tips
- Be prepared to explain the time and space complexity of the traversal algorithm (O(n) where n is the number of views)
- Discuss potential optimizations like caching or indexing for faster lookups
- Consider edge cases: empty views, duplicate IDs, deep hierarchies
- Be ready to extend the design to include more UI functionality like event handling or styling
