# Low-Level Design (LLD) Interviews at Amazon: A Comprehensive Guide

## What is a Low-Level Design (LLD) Interview?

LLD interviews focus on your ability to design the internal components, classes, and interactions of a software system. Unlike High-Level Design (HLD) which deals with system architecture, databases, and servers, LLD is concerned with:

- Class and object design
- Data structures and algorithms
- Design patterns
- Object-oriented principles
- Code organization and relationships

## What Amazon Looks For in LLD Interviews

1. **Object-Oriented Design Skills**: 
   - Proper class hierarchies and relationships
   - Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction
   - Interface vs implementation separation

2. **Design Pattern Knowledge**:
   - Recognizing when to apply common patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, etc.)
   - Understanding the tradeoffs between different patterns
   - Implementing patterns correctly in code

3. **SOLID Principles**:
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Open/Closed Principle
   - Liskov Substitution Principle
   - Interface Segregation Principle
   - Dependency Inversion Principle

4. **Clean, Maintainable Code**:
   - Readable class and method names
   - Proper error handling
   - Appropriate comments
   - Well-organized code structure

5. **Problem-Solving Approach**:
   - How you break down complex problems
   - Your thought process and design decisions
   - Ability to handle requirements changes

## Common LLD Interview Questions at Amazon

The examples in this repository represent common LLD interview questions at Amazon. They typically fall into these categories:

1. **Real-World Object Modeling**:
   - Parking Lot (ParkingLot.py)
   - Amazon Locker System (AmazonPackageDelivery.py)

2. **Game Design**:
   - Tic-Tac-Toe (TicTacToe.py)
   - Blackjack (Blackjack_Game.py)

3. **Amazon Service Modeling**:
   - Music Streaming Service (AmazonMusic.py)
   - Package Delivery System (AmazonPackageDelivery.py)

4. **Common Software Components**:
   - Rate Limiter (Rate Limiter.py)
   - File System (LinuxFileSystem.py)
   - UI Component Hierarchy (UI.py)

5. **Algorithmic System Design**:
   - Course Scheduler with prerequisites (Course_Schedule.py)

## General Approach for LLD Interviews

1. **Clarify Requirements** (2-3 minutes):
   - Ask questions to understand the exact problem scope
   - Identify core functionality vs. "nice-to-have" features
   - Establish constraints and assumptions

2. **Define Core Classes and Relationships** (5-7 minutes):
   - Identify the main entities/objects
   - Define their attributes and behaviors
   - Establish relationships (has-a, is-a, uses)
   - Draw a simple class diagram if possible

3. **Apply Design Patterns** (3-5 minutes):
   - Identify appropriate design patterns
   - Explain why they're suitable for this problem
   - Modify your design to incorporate them

4. **Implementation Details** (10-15 minutes):
   - Write pseudocode or actual code for key methods
   - Focus on the most important classes and interactions
   - Demonstrate understanding of language features and OOP concepts

5. **Testing and Edge Cases** (2-3 minutes):
   - Discuss how you would test your design
   - Address potential edge cases and error conditions
   - Propose enhancements or optimizations

## Tips for Success

1. **Practice, Practice, Practice**:
   - Implement multiple designs from scratch
   - Review and critique existing designs
   - Study common design patterns and when to use them

2. **Think Aloud**:
   - Explain your thought process as you design
   - Discuss tradeoffs between different approaches
   - Show that you're considering multiple factors

3. **Ask Clarifying Questions**:
   - Don't make assumptions about requirements
   - It's okay to ask for guidance or feedback
   - Confirm your understanding before proceeding

4. **Be Adaptable**:
   - Requirements may change during the interview
   - Be ready to modify your design accordingly
   - Show that you can handle evolving requirements

5. **Know Amazon's Leadership Principles**:
   - Customer Obsession: How does your design benefit the end user?
   - Ownership: How would you ensure reliability and quality?
   - Invent and Simplify: Is your design elegant and maintainable?
   - Dive Deep: Can you explain the details of your implementation?

Remember, the interviewer is not just assessing your technical skills but also your problem-solving approach, communication abilities, and how you respond to feedback. Good luck with your Amazon SDE interview!
